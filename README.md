# Structural Analysis of a Mechanical Bracket (FEA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a finite element structural analysis of a mechanical bracket performed using ANSYS Workbench as part of a Mechanical Design & Simulation internship task.

## 🛠️ Tools & Software
- ANSYS Workbench (Static Structural)

## 🧱 Geometry Description
The analyzed component is an L-shaped mechanical bracket designed to support structural loads.  
The geometry includes mounting holes and realistic dimensions suitable for industrial applications.

## 📊 Results
- Von Mises stress distribution identified critical stress regions
- Total deformation remained within acceptable limits
- Factor of safety confirmed the structural integrity of the component

## 📁 Repository Content
- ANSYS simulation files
- Result screenshots (stress, deformation, FOS)
